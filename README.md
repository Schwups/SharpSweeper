# SharpSweeper
MineSweeper rewritten in C#.
There is probably so many better ways to do what my code does but it works so i dont care.
It includes:
 variable difficulties which can be chosen via the in app menu,
 a currently unused settings menu (if i can think of something to add to it i will),
 and a few easter eggs.
I wrote this for fun and to practice my skills in C# and while i highly doubt anyone would want to use this peice of shit code if anyone wants to then feel free.
